Full objective: "Given a scenario, analyze indicators of malicious activity."

### An Overview of Malware
- Malware: malicious software that can gather information, show you advertising, encrypt your data, and overall ruin your day :(
- Malware types and methods
	- Virus
	- Worm
	- Ransomware
	- Trojan Horse
	- Rootkit, Keylogger, Spyware, Bloatware, Logic bomb, etc.
- How you get malware
	- Worm exploits a vulnerability, installs malware with a remote access backdoor
	- Your computer must run a program (email links, website pop-ups, drive-by download, and sometimes worms)
- Your data is valuable
	- Personal data (pictures, videos, tax documents)
	- Organizational data (planning documents, employee PII, financial info)
- Ransomware
	- Encrypt all data on computer and request money
	- Encrypted with a very strong symmetric or asymmetric key
	- Using an untraceable payment method like cryptocurrency (blockchain)
- Protecting against ransomware
	- Make backups
	- Keep OS and applications up to date
	- Keep anti-virus/-malware signatures up to date
### Viruses and Worms
- Malware that can reproduce itself
- Reproduces through filesystem or network
- Some cause immediate problems, some are invisible
- Anti-virus is very common, update signatures!!!
- Virus types
	- Program viruses
	- Boot sector viruses
	- Script viruses
	- Macro Viruses
- Fileless virus
	- Stealth attack, avoids detection
	- Operates in memory, never installed
- Worms
	- Malware that self-replicates without user interaction
	- Can take over systems very quickly
	- Firewalls and IDS/IPS can mitigate
	- WannaCry ![[wannacry.png]]
### Spyware and Bloatware
- Spyware
	- Spies on you for advertising, ID theft, etc.
	- Can trick you into installing 
	- Browser monitoring and keyloggers
- Protecting against spyware
	- Maintain anti-virus/-malware (latest signatures)
	- Always know what you're installing
	- Always have a backup
	- Run malware scans
- Bloatware
	- New device has OS necessary apps, but also unnecessary ones
	- May use storage and open device to vulnerabilities
- Removing uninstaller
	- Use built-in uninstaller
	- Some apps have their own uninstaller
	- Third-party uninstaller
### Other Malware Types
- Keyloggers
	- Logins, passwords, emails, etc.
	- Keystrokes captured and sent
	- Circumvents encryption
	- Other data logging: clipboard, screen, instant message
- Logic bomb
	- Waits for predefined event
	- Time or date, user event
	- Difficult to identify and recover
- Preventing a logic bomb
	- Formal change control
	- Electronic monitoring (IPS/IDS)
	- Constant auditing
- Rootkit
	- Originally a Unix technique
	- Modifies core system files (kernel)
	- Can be invisible to OS, has full control
- Finding and removing rootkits
	- Look for unusual
	- Use a remover specific to rootkit
	- Secure boot with UEFI
### Physical Attacks
- Old-school security, locks and guards
- If you have physical access to a server, you have full control
- "Door locks keep out the honest people"
- Brute force
	- Physical version... lol
	- Push through / break obstruction
- RFID cloning
	- Access badges, key fobs
	- Duplicators are cheap and effectives
	- A good reason for MFA
- Environmental attacks
	- Attack everything
	- Power monitoring
	- HVAC and humidity controls
	- Fire suppression
### Denial of Service
- Force a service to fail by overloading
- Take advantage of design failure or vulnerability
- Cause systems to be unavailable to cause a smoke screen
- "Friendly" DoS
	- Layer 2 loop without STP
	- Downloading large files over DSL line
	- Water line breaks
	- Pressing two generic remotes at the same time!
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
	- Launch an army of computers to bring down a service
	- Usually assembled via a botnet
		- At peak, Zeus infected >3.6 mil PCs
	- Asymmetric attack, attacker may have limited resources but inflates them
- DDoS reflection and amplification
	- Abuse specific devices/protocols that respond with more data then probed
	- DNS amplification (~15 --> ~1300 characters) ![[dns-amplification.png]]
	- DNS amplification DDoS ![[dns-ddos.png]]
