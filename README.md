This is an organized list of notes on the free SY0-701 course by Professor Messer.

I have folders for each test domain and markdown notes for each objective with headings following his video series, the exception being the introduction video notes: [[How to Pass Your SY0-701 Security+ Exam]].

This note set is meant to be viewed in Obsidian or a markdown reader.

Thanks,
Luke
