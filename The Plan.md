I want to take CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 before the end of summer 2024 (before the start of the fall school semester). Better yet, it would be ideal if I have it done by the end of July. With that in mind, here is my tentative study plan for the next 7 weeks:

*EDIT*: I fell behind after week 2. I've modified the schedule dates to reflect this. I will still be taking the test before the start of the fall semester.

*EDIT 2*: I fell behind again after week 3 due to moving out of my apartment - more of an exception than a failure. Modified again to reflect.

**Learning**: 5 weeks
**Further studying and reviewing**: 1 week
**Taking the test**: 1 week window

Note: 
- Professor Messer has 121 videos in this series. For a 5-week plan, that puts you at just over 24 videos per week. I tried to reflect this in the weekly spread as closely as possible, but, in my opinion, it's more productive to have unbalanced weeks than to split an objective over a weekend. Thus, week 2 gets overloaded to 29 videos because of 2.3 and 2.4 having *14 and 15 videos respectively* (jeez).
