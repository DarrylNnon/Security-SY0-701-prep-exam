Full objective: "Compare and contrast security implications of different
architecture models."

### Cloud Infrastructures
- Cloud responsibility matrix
	- IaaS, PaaS, SaaS... who is responsible for security? Should be well documented
	- ![[ex-resp-matrix.png]]
- Hybrid considerations
	- Hybrid cloud - more than one public or private cloud
	- Network protection mismatches - auth, firewall, server settings
	- Different security monitoring
	- Data leakage
- Third-party vendors in the cloud
	- You, the cloud provider, and third parties
	- Ongoing vendor risk assessments to maintain posture of third-parties
	- Constant monitoring
- Infrastructure as code
	- Describe an infrastructure (servers, network, and apps) as code
	- Modify infrastructure and create versions
	- Use the code as a template to build more instances
	- Very important concept for cloud computing
- Serverless architecture
	- Function as a Service (FaaS)
		- Apps separated into functions
		- Remove OS from the equation
	- Dev still creates the server-side logic
	- May be event-triggered
	- Managed by third-party
- Microservices and APIs
	- Old: monolithic applications running locally, hard to manage
	- New: Application Programming Interfaces, "glue" for the microservices, scalable
