Full objective: "Summarize fundamental security concepts."

### The CIA Triad
- Combination of principles, the fundamentals of security (not to be confused with the Central Intelligence Agency)
- **C - Confidentiality**: prevent disclosure of info to those unauthorized
- **I - Integrity**: information cannot be modified without detection
- **A - Availability**: systems and networks must be up and running
- ![[cia-triad.png]]
- Confidentiality
	- Certain info should only be known to certain people
	- Encryption, access controls
- Integrity
	- Data is stored and transferred as intended
	- Hashing, digital signatures, certificates, non-repudiation
- Availability
	- Info accessible to authorized used
	- Redundancy, fault tolerance, patching

### Non-repudiation
- You cannot deny what you've said, like signing a digital contract
- Proof of integrity
	- Verify data remains accurate and consistent
	- Can be attained using a hash, data as a short string of text
		- If data changes at all, "fingerprint" changes entirely
	- However... this doesn't associate data with an individual
- Proof of origin
	- Proving the source of the message (authentication)
	- Sign with digital "private key" (only known by sender of data)
		- Verified with "public key"
- Creating a digital signature
